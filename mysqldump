first use mysqldump to capture your present db (just in case).
CODE: SELECT ALL
mysqldump asterisk > 2012_08_06_XXXXXXXXXXX.sql
If using a password, you'll need to add "-p" and enter the pass at the prompt.

then drop the existing database and recreate it
CODE: SELECT ALL
mysql -e "drop database asterisk"
mysql -e "create database asterisk"

then apply the mysql backup to it.
CODE: SELECT ALL
mysql asterisk < Prior_backup_name.sql

It may be a good idea to reboot. It's definitely a good idea to tell the server to rebuild the conf files under Admin->Servers->(select your server)
